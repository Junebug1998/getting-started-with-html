  <b> Basics of the Web and HTML</b><br>
<br>
Browsers,Internet, Servers and HTTP<br>
<br>
HTML: Hypertext Markup Language <br>
  Text Content = or what you see<br>
  Markup = or what it looks like<br>
  References to other documents = Videos & Images<br>
  Links to other Pages<br> <Br>
HTML Markup <br>  
Multiple Tag descriptions<br>
 How tags are structured and using them. Closing tag has /<br>
 So you have opening and closing tags 
 <br>
  <b> Bold tags are cool </b><br>
  <em>Italic tags are even better</em><br>
  <em>Then you have the issues of no closing tag as in this example where the italics never end......<br>
  <br>
  <b> HTML Attributes</b><br></em>
  Anchor Tag "a"<br>
  <br>

   <b>Images</b> <br>

    <br>

    You may be wondering why anchor tags use the href attribute while img tags use the src attribute. And you may become frustrated when (not if) you make the mistake of using one when you really need the other. Because when you make this mistake, your HTML will not work.

So how will you ever remember details like this?

Well... you don't have to!

In fact, you may have already forgotten how to add links to HTML. That's fine. Unless you're writing HTML all the time, details like these aren't worth remembering. A Google search for "adding links in html" will always get you your answer.

New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts.

But programming doesn't work like that! There's just too many facts to remember them all.

Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them.

So continue with this lesson and don't worry about remembering everything. At the end of the lesson, we'll do a recap of what is  important.<br>

<b> Bold Tags</b> <br> <b>Span and Div</b><br><br>
That's right! a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements while div, p, and form are block elements.<br> <br>
